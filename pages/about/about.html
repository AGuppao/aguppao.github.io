            <h3>The Scientific Approach to Marketing</h3>
            <p>
                Pearson's Law states: <strong>"What is measured, improves"</strong>. So how does this apply to marketing?
            </p>
            
            <div id="sci-marketing">
                In marketing, the "scientific method" means that by tracking and analyzing key performance indicators such as conversion rates, customer acquisition
                cost, and customer lifetime value, businesses can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions...
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>Boring right...?</strong>
                <br>
                Don't worry, we understand. This stuff is also very time-consuming. It's very much systematic trial and error, meaning it can
                also be quite expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a company run by engineers, <strong>we are experts in the scientific method</strong>. We know how to apply it to maximize your marketing
                campaign's effectiveness, all whilst minimizing your costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do this so you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.
