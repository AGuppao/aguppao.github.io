Especially if you're new to it.</p><p>Don't worry, Meta has a feature that can bypass all of the complexities, Boosts.</p><p>And it's awful.</p><p>So, what actually are Boosts and why should you avoid using it?</p><br><h2>What are Boosts?</h2><p>Before Boosts, Meta noticed that not that many people were using Meta Ads, so were missing out on potential revenue.</p><p>They realised that the Ads Manager was quite complicated. So, to get more people spending money on Meta, they introduced Boosts.</p><p>The Boost feature is a super simplified version of Meta Ads.</p><p>In short, you would create a regular post, then pay Meta to show that post (Boost it) to a larger audience.</p><p>Sounds great, right?</p><p>Well... not exactly.</p><p>There are many problems with Boosts.</p><p>In fact, many people are throwing away their money on Boosts when they should be using Meta Ads.</p><p>So, what's wrong with Boosts?</p><br><h2>Boosts are a Neutered Version of Meta Ads</h2><p>Not seeing any results when using Boosts?</p><p>Well, that's normal. After all, Boosts are just a neutered version of regular ads.</p><p>I mean, you are <strong>losing almost all control</strong> over the ad:</p><ul><li><p>You're limited to specific types of posts.</p></li><li><p>You can't effectively target a particular audience based on an action you want to take.</p></li><li><p>You can't run the ad on both Facebook and Instagram.</p></li></ul><p>Actually, that last point is super important.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because you <strong>have to create a separate post for each platform and Boost each post separately</strong> - which is expensive.</p><p>And, if you're using Meta IOS, you have to pay a <a class="hyperext" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/347839548598012" target="_blank">30% service fee to Apple just to use Boosts</a> - not ideal.</p><p>In fact, there are so many problems with Boosts that it's hard to explain them all. And I won't bore you with all of them.</p><p>So, what should you use instead of Boosts?</p><br><h2>Use Meta Ads for Massive Results</h2><p>Now, the UI does look complicated.</p><p>But, it won't take a huge amount of time to get used to.</p><p>And it's absolutely worth it.</p><p>You can create a single ad and have it show on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>You have full control over the ad including an entire list of options.</p><p>You are given a huge list of metrics to help you figure out what's wrong with your ad.</p><p>And the best thing?</p><p><strong>You're not charged upfront for using Meta Ads, unlike Boosts</strong>.</p><p>So, if your ad doesn't work as expected, you haven't wasted all of your money on it.</p><p>And I've already talked about the <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/use-meta-ads-to-cut-advertising-costs-and-gain-massive-results/">costs of using Meta Ads before</a>.</p><br><p>So, no more using Boosts, unless you hate money.</p><p>Instead, you have to use Meta Ads.</p><p>After all, it gives you more options, better targeting and most importantly... WAY more results.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Don't have the time to learn how to use Meta Ads?</strong></p><a href="/free-consultation/" class="fancy-button">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a rel="nofollow" id="fb" href="https://www.facebook.com/" class="fa fa-facebook" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="in" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" class="fa fa-linkedin" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="gm" href="mailto:admin" class="fa fa-envelope" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img id="footer-logo" src="#" alt="logo"><hr><div id="legal" class="flex-row"><p>Â© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
