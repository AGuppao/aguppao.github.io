It will help you retain your prospect's attention and prevent decision paralysis.</p></div><hr/><div id="blog-content"><p>Hey, just a small favour. Can you read this ad copy and tell me how you'd get in touch with me?</p><p>"Do you need help boosting your marketing performance? Well, we can help you. We're really good at digital marketing and we've been doing this for 10+ years. We've also won many awards. We also have many certificates from well known institutions so we're an expert in the field, just like every other company with the exact same qualifications. Start by filling out this <a class="hyperint" href="/free-consultation/">form so we can get in touch</a>. Also, you can send me an email or text me. You could also call me. Why not check out <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-write-an-ad-that-sells/">this blog</a>, or visit my website?"</p><p>There's a lot of ways to contact me, right?</p><p>That's where the problem starts. And there are so many companies making this mistake.</p><p>That paragraph contains too much information. Especially considering that it's supposed to be for an ad.</p><p>So, how can being simple help you boost your marketing performance?</p><p>And what can you do to simplify your marketing?</p><br/><h2>What's Wrong with Too Much Information</h2><p>I've spent an entire blog talking about why being <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/improve-your-marketing-by-not-being-boring/">boring is a massive crime in marketing</a>.</p><p>The important part of that blog was that text overloads are boring.</p><p>And a lot of businesses keep on making that mistake.</p><p>They just overload their ads with information:</p><ul><li><p>Too much generic text</p></li><li><p>Too many images, awards, certificates etc</p></li><li><p>Too many CTAs</p></li></ul><p>I've already discussed the first two things. But, what about the last one?</p><br/><h2>Too Many CTAs Lead to Decision Paralysis</h2><p>So, your ad must have a call-to-action (CTA). I mean, how else is a prospect going to know what to do after seeing your ad?</p><p>Some ads don't contain any CTAs. And others contain too many.</p><p>For example, they might list 5 different ways to contact the same person (like email, phone, social media etc).</p><p>So, why is this a problem?</p><p>If you give a prospect too many choices, then they're going to become decision paralysed. So they won't do anything. Meaning they won't get in touch with you.</p><p>That defeats the whole purpose of a CTA.</p><p>And this isn't restricted to ads.</p><p>I mean, the amount of websites that have buttons and links flying around the screen is completely insane. But I'll talk about this in a separate blog.</p><p>In short, you can't afford to confuse a prospect.</p><p>After all, they have a reduced attention span, which makes things even more difficult for you.</p><br/><h2>The Attention Span Problem</h2><p>So, that massive paragraph at the start of this blog...</p><p>Did you actually read all of it?</p><p>Probably not, right?</p><p>Well, that's because it's too long. It's too boring. It's too complex.</p><p>I'm losing your attention writing all of that.</p><p>And your attention span is probably not that bad (compared to the average person).</p><p>And if your marketing is at all similar to that paragraph, then you're prospects won't read it either.</p><p>I mean, with TikTok, Instagram and all of that "short-form" content, the average person's attention span has been completely ruined.</p><p>So, you need to get their attention as fast as possible and keep it for as long as possible.</p><p>And that's where simple marketing comes in.</p><p>So, how can being simple help you boost your marketing performance?</p><br/><h2>Simplify Your Marketing to Attract More Prospects</h2><p>There's actually a super simple rule you can use to make sure your ad (and other forms of marketing) don't just contain jargon.</p><p>It's called Pareto's Law. You might have heard it be called the 80-20 rule.</p><p>Pareto's Law states:</p><p>"20% of something is responsible for 80% of something else".</p><p>So, what does that mean?</p><p>Well, it means that 20% of an ad is responsible for 80% of leads generated from that ad.</p><p>So, how can you actually use this rule?</p><p>Let's say you've made an ad that contains a bunch of text and images.</p><p>The 80-20 rule tells you that you could cut out 80% of the body and still get 80% of the leads.</p><p>And the 80% you could cut out is within the images and body text.</p><p>So, you're left with the headline, a small body and a CTA.</p><p>And that's all you need. Especially if you're trying to get your prospect's attention.</p><p>No text overloads. No pointless images. Just the headline, a small body and a CTA.</p><br/><p>So, let's keep everything simple.</p><p>You're less likely to cause decision paralysis for your prospects.</p><p>You can even save time making ads by only including the important bits of information.</p><p>Those important bits are the headline, a small body and the CTA.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br/>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want to know how I would simplify your marketing and land you more clients?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="contact fb fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Message us on Facebook"></a><a class="contact in fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="contact gm fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><p>Â© 2025 Guppao Marketing</p><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a><a href="/legal/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
