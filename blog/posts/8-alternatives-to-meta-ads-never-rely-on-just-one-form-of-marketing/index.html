Right?</p><p>So, what does this analogy have to do with marketing?</p><br><h2>One is the Worst Number in Business</h2><p>Why?</p><p>Because you're dead in the water if that 'one' is taken away.</p><p>It's like that jet analogy from before - if that one engine fails, it's going to cause some problems.</p><p>And what makes your business any different?</p><p>Think about it for a second...</p><p><strong>One</strong> key member of staff.</p><p><strong>One</strong> big client.</p><p><strong>One</strong> source of leads.</p><p>What happens if that 'one' is taken away?</p><p>The 'best case' scenario is that your business struggles to grow a bit.

What could go wrong with Meta Ads?</p><p>Your account gets blocked. Meta's servers go down. Social media gets banned by the government...</p><p>It doesn't really matter what could happen. What matters is what you can do about it.</p><p>So, what should you be doing to prevent the 'ones' from causing problems for your marketing?</p><br><h2>8 Alternatives to Meta Ads to Use Alongside Meta Ads</h2><p>Are your Meta Ads working?</p><p>Great, then let's keep finding more ways to push that ad to more people.</p><p>And if Meta Ads didn't work for you, then let's try something else.</p><p>I mean, we are spoiled for options:</p><ul><li><p>Google Ads</p></li><li><p>Email Marketing</p></li><li><p>Content Marketing</p></li><li><p>Affiliate Marketing</p></li><li><p>Event Marketing</p></li><li><p>Print Advertising</p></li><li><p>Direct Mail</p></li><li><p>Telemarketing</p></li></ul><p>Now, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages.
