Who's your ideal customer?</p><p>If you responded with <i>"Anyone with a pulse and money..."</i>, I've got some bad news for you.</p><p>99% of these people won't even care about your company's existence, let alone buy from you.</p><p>So, how can you find people who are actually interested in your company?</p><br><h2>Stop Trying to Sell to Everyone</h2><p>I've already said this exact same thing <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/attract-more-clients-using-2-step-lead-generation/">previously</a>. And I won't stop bringing this up.</p><p>Just to be clear, when I say 'stop selling to everyone', what I really mean is that you shouldn't try advertising your offer to everyone.</p><p><strong>You should show your offer to people who are interested in your company</strong> - your target audience.</p><p>So... What's wrong with showing your offer to everyone?</p><p>In short, it's expensive.</p><p>You'd end up spending so much just trying to reach everyone, but you never make that money back from sales - the people you've reached just aren't interested.</p><p>This defeats the whole point of marketing.</p><p>I mean, marketing is you trying to sell something. Right?</p><p>So, you need a target audience.</p><p>But, there's just one small issue...</p><br><h2>How Can You Find Your Target Audience?</h2><p>You could mass print leaflets, post them to everyone and wait for a response.</p><p>But, few people actually read leaflets - they usually go straight into the bin. So this is a waste of money.</p><p>What about going door-to-door and asking each person if they are interested?</p><p>Even if this was effective, it's incredibly time-consuming.</p><p>How about <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/attract-more-clients-using-2-step-lead-generation/">two-step lead generation</a> and <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/continuously-close-clients-using-retargeting/">retargeting</a> to find people who are interested in your company?</p><p>This is a better approach. But, it still takes some time to setup and run.</p><p>In fact, most methods are either not effective or they are time-consuming.</p><p>I guess this is why most business owners don't care about trying to find a target audience.</p><p>So, Is there a fast and effective way to find your target audience?</p><br><h2>How Meta Finds Your Target Audience</h2><p>Meta is a useful tool for finding your target audience.</p><p>How exactly does Meta do this?</p><p>Basically, Meta figures out what people like and shows them ads based on their interests.</p><p>I give a super short outline of how this works <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/continuously-close-clients-using-retargeting/">in this blog</a>.</p><p>In that blog, I mentioned these things called Cookies and stated that they were useful.</p><p>But what actually are they? And what makes them so useful?</p><br><h3>What Are Cookies?</h3><p>Basically, whenever someone interacts with your online content, they get this thing called a Cookie.</p><p>This is like the visitor picking up a postcard that says "I was here".</p><p>So... how does this help you find your target audience?</p><br><h3>Cookies Mark Your Target Audience</h3><p>If people who have interacted with your content have this Cookie thing, then guess what...</p><p><strong>...these 'Cookie holders' are your target audience!</strong></p><p>These are the people who are actually interested in your company.</p><p>After all, whoever has your Cookies is literally saying "I was here".</p><p>But wait, there's more...</p><br><h3>Use Competitor Cookies to Find Your Audience Even Faster</h3><p>You won't be the only person "giving out" Cookies. <strong>Your competitors will be doing this as well</strong>.</p><p>Let's go back to the postcard analogy.</p><p>Imagine someone has postcards from Germany, Spain and France. It's probably safe to say that they like visiting Europe. And you could say that they might be interested in visiting Italy. Right?</p><p>Now replace Germany, Spain and France with your competitors, Europe with your niche, Italy with your company and postcards with Cookies.</p><p>So what does all of this mean?</p><p>Well... you have a much faster way of finding who's interested in your niche.</p><p>Simply <strong>find the people who have 'competitor Cookies'</strong> - they'll likely be interested in your offer.</p><p>So, you just need to do some technical stuff to get these Cookies to work. Right?</p><br><h3>Meta Automates the Super Technical Stuff</h3><p>Meta handles all of that technical stuff for you.</p><p>From giving out these Cookies to finding people who have them and showing your ads to them.</p><p>All you need to do is tell Meta a little bit about your business, set up an ad or two and let the algorithms do their magic.</p><br><p>So, Cookies are a super fast and effective way to find your target audience.</p><p>You can use Meta to handle all of the technical stuff for you, including finding your target audience and directly advertising to them.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want to know how I would mix all this with Meta ads to boost your marketing performance?</strong></p><a href="/free-consultation/" class="fancy-button">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a rel="nofollow" id="fb" href="https://www.facebook.com/" class="fa fa-facebook" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="in" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" class="fa fa-linkedin" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="gm" href="mailto:admin" class="fa fa-envelope" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img id="footer-logo" src="#" alt="logo"><hr><div id="legal" class="flex-row"><p>Â© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
