            <p>Most ads are like a wild fever dream, riddled with random mascots, nonsense dialogues and over the top effects. They fail on so many levels.</p>
            <p>So, why are they so bad?</p>
            <p>More importantly, what can you do to make sure your ads don't become like this?</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Writing a Killer Ad Headline</h2>
            <p>You probably experience this all the time. You look at an ad and just can't figure out what it's for.</p>
            <p>You think: <i>"What's the point of this?"</i></p>
            <p>In today's day and age, people's attention spans have dropped drastically. So, your ad must quickly get their attention.</p>
            <p>You need them to instantly understand what your ad is about.</p>
            <p>How?</p>
            <p>By using a <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/meta-ads-quickly-hook-your-audience/"><strong>clear and concise headline</strong></a>. One which highlights the problem the target audience might face.</p>
            <p>For example, instead of: "Guppao Marketing. We can help you grow your business through effective marketing."</p>
            <p>Do: "Need help attracting more clients?"</p>
            <p>This leads me on to my next point.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Tailor the Ad for Your Target Audience</h2>
            <p>Nobody cares about "we", they only care about "I". In other words, they only care about themselves.</p>
            <p>Your ad shouldn't be a lecture about your company's background, or even your brand. Well, unless you have millions of pounds to throw away…</p>
            <p><strong>So don't put the brand first!</strong></p>
            <p>This rule applies to all forms of marketing: posters, websites, digital ads and everything else.</p>
            <p>The person seeing the ad won't care about the brand.</p>
            <p>Your ads must focus on the <strong>pain points</strong> of your target audience. What problems are your target audience facing? How can you solve these problems?</p>
            <p>You need to answer the question: <i>"What's in it for me?"</i></p>
            <br>

            <h2>A CTA Does the Selling</h2>
            <p>This is probably by far the <strong>worst mistake</strong> I see soooo many ads make.</p>
            <p>Let's back up for a second.</p>
            <p>So, you've connected with the audience via your headline. You've identified their problems. You may even have listed some solutions. But now what?</p>
            <p>Simple.</p>
            <p><strong>Get the audience engaged in whatever it is you're providing. Get them to contact you!</strong></p>
            <p>How can you do this?</p>
            <p><strong>Include a CTA</strong>, a call-to-action.</p>
            <p>For example, direct them to your website. Give them your email address, phone number, social media account.</p>
            <p>Don't leave prospects thinking: <i>"Ok… So now what do I do?"</i></p>
            <p>Also, make your CTA obvious. Make it stand out. The CTA is completely redundant if the prospect doesn't see it.</p>
            <p>Another, less talked-about, benefit to CTA's is that you can now <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/ace-data-driven-marketing/">monitor the performance of your campaign</a>. Unfortunately, I'm all out of time for now.</p>
            <br>

            <p>So, let's start boosting your ads' performance. Start using a clear and concise headline. Focus on the problems your target audience is facing. Include a CTA to get clients.</p>
