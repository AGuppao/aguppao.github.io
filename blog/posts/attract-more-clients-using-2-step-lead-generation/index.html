Instead, provide valuable information to a large audience, then focus on the people who interact positively with your content (they are your target audience).</p></div><hr/><div id="blog-content"><p>Have you ever seen an ad where the company is giving away a bunch of free stuff? For example, guides, e-books and courses amongst other things.</p><p>Wouldn't they be better off selling all of that valuable information instead of just giving it away for free?</p><p>Well... it turns out that this is an incredibly powerful marketing tactic. It's called Two-Step lead generation.</p><p>So how can this be used to get your business more clients?</p><br/><h2>Biggest Mistake with One-Step Lead Generation</h2><p>Most companies focus on marketing directly to prospects.</p><p>This is called 1-step lead generation. It works quite well. That's if it's used correctly, which it almost never is.</p><p>What do I mean by this?</p><p><strong>1-Step lead generation must be used with your target audience</strong>. After all, they are the ones that might be interested in your offer.</p><p>Most businesses make an ad and show it to absolutely every single soul on the planet. Prospect. Strangers. Cats.</p><p>This "spray and pray" style of marketing doesn't work. This simply burns through a company's bank account.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because most of the people who see the ad aren't interested.</p><p>So the company can't sell to these people. EVER.</p><p>By showing your offer to the right audience, 1-step lead generation could help grow your business.</p><p>But it's probably not enough on its own.</p><br/><h2>Two-Step Lead Generation</h2><p>To actually sell something, <strong>show your offer to the people that are interested</strong>.</p><p>So all you need to do now is find people who are interested in your company and your offer.</p><p>To do this, let's look at the full 2-step lead generation (2SLG) method:</p><ol><li>Provide valuable content (blog, informative ad, guides) to a large audience.</li><li>Find the people who interacted with the content (using tools like Meta Pixel, Google Analytics, CTAs).</li><li>Run a specific ad with the actual offer to the people who interacted with the content.</li></ol><h3>Value First</h3><p>I recently wrote a blog about the <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/customer-journey-attract-prospects-before-the-competition/">customer's journey</a>.</p><p>In short, if you can <strong>find prospects during the awareness and consideration stages</strong> of their journey, then they are far more likely to buy from you.</p><p>After all, these people are actually interested in your offer.</p><p>To do this, you need to provide valuable information / content.</p><p>So... what sort of content should you provide?</p><p>Literally anything. I mean, just <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/">look at my blogs</a>, or even this <a class="hyperint" href="/marketing-guides/">free guide</a>.</p><p>If the content is valuable and is related to your niche, then you can share it.</p><p>Typical examples of valuable content include:</p><ul><li>Common mistakes</li><li>Changes to law</li><li>Safety information</li><li>New technology</li></ul><h3>Sell Second</h3><p>So... you have an audience who are interested in your offer.</p><p>Now you can advertise your offer to this audience.</p><p>You're far more likely to see positive results doing it this way versus showing everyone on Earth your offer.</p><p><i>"But I'm doing more stuff, so how is it cheaper than just advertising my offer?"</i></p><p><strong>The cost per acquisition (CPA) is lower, not your total costs</strong>.</p><p>CPA is the total costs divided by the total number of acquisitions. So more acquisitions lead to a lower CPA, even if the total costs go up a bit.</p><p>And you're going to make that money back with your new clients anyway.</p><p>Even if you don't want to spend more money on this, social media posts, blogs and guides are completely free to make and share.</p><p>And the best part, you can recycle ideas. Break down blogs into a series of shorter social media posts.</p><p>Show those posts to an audience. And the 2SLG process starts over.</p><br/><p>So, 2SLG is great for gaining new customers by showing them valuable content. But, what about the people who have already shown interest in your company? How can you keep reminding them of your offers?</p><p>For that, we need <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/continuously-close-clients-using-retargeting/">retargeting</a>, a topic I'll discuss soon.</p><p>For now, start showing your offers to prospects who are actually interested.</p><p>Use the two-step lead generation method to find these people.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br/>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want me to take a look at your 2-step lead generation methods?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="contact fb fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Message us on Facebook"></a><a class="contact in fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="contact gm fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><p>Â© 2025 Guppao Marketing</p><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a><a href="/legal/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
