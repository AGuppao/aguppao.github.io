Be it a coat, a lawnmower or a car. Then, before you know it, every time you go on the Internet, you see a plethora of ads for that product for a week straight.</p><p>This is called 'retargeting' and it is another very powerful marketing technique.</p><p>But it's almost never used properly... at least by smaller businesses.</p><p>So, how does retargeting work and how can you use it to continuously land more clients?</p><br/><h2>Many Businesses Ignore this Simple Fact</h2><p>Customers don't buy from you out of impulse. They go through a phase before they decide to buy anything.</p><p>This 'phase' is called the <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/customer-journey-attract-prospects-before-the-competition/">customer journey</a> and I've already talked about it in a previous blog.</p><p>If you can reach your customers earlier in this 'journey', then they are more likely to buy from you.</p><p>I've already discussed how the customer journey stuff can be used in <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/attract-more-clients-using-2-step-lead-generation/">2-Step Lead Generation (2SLG)</a> to attract new clients.</p><p>But there's a small problem. People are forgetful.</p><p>By 'forgetful', I really mean that <strong>prospects might not be ready to buy from you then and there</strong>. And in doing so, they 'forget' about your company.</p><p>The reasons don't matter too much. What matters is that 'now' is not the time. So you need to <strong>'remind' them later to take action</strong>.</p><p>So how can you 'remind' prospects to buy from you without nagging them with a river of emails?</p><br/><h2>Retargeting Prospects for Infinite Sales</h2><p>Retargeting is essentially you frequently checking up on a prospect, like: <i>"Hey, did you ever fix that problem? Do you want help with it now?"</i>.</p><p>You're simply reminding the prospect that you can still solve their problem.</p><p>And if they haven't already solved it and they're ready to fix it now, then you're already right in front of them.</p><p>And this is why retargeting is so amazing. Especially for smaller businesses.</p><p>You've basically cut past the competition by always being there for your prospects.</p><p><i>"So... how exactly does retargeting differ from 2SLG?"</i></p><br/><h2>2-Step Lead Generation vs Retargeting</h2><p>2SLG and retargeting sound very similar.</p><p>That's because they both rely on the same basic idea - <strong>only sell to people who are actually interested in your offer</strong>.</p><p>They both do this by finding people who have interacted with your company in some way.</p><p>The main differences between the two are their specific use cases and how they are used to determine who is interested in your company.</p><p>For example, 2SLG involves a user showing interest in some of your content (like subscribing to a newsletter) and then you follow up with them (sales call / email).</p><p>Here you'd use something like an email list or a CTA to find out who is interested in your content.</p><p><strong>Retargeting uses cookies to display relevant ads</strong> to users who have engaged with your company in some way (like visiting your website).</p><p>The neat thing about this, it's pretty much fully automated by default.</p><p>So you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p><p>Actually, this Cookie thing is <i>huge</i>. I'll spare the gory details for a separate blog.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, start using retargeting to land even more clients by regularly reminding prospects that you have solutions to their problems.</p><p>Also, be sure to only target prospects who have actually shown interest in some way.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br/>Abhay Gupta</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want us to help implement retargeting to your marketing?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" id="fb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a class="fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" id="in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" id="gm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><p>Â© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
