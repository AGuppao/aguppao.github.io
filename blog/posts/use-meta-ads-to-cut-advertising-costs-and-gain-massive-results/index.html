Imagine the publicity you'd get from that.</p><p>Well, you could do that... if you have a small country's GDP as your marketing budget.</p><p>And this is the same for <strong>almost all other forms of advertising</strong>.</p><p>Looking for a cheaper way to advertise your company?</p><p>Then, you have to use Meta Ads.</p><p>So, what makes Meta Ads the cheapest form of advertising?</p><p>And what mistakes do other companies make when using Meta Ads that you can avoid?</p><br><h2>Why Meta Ads are the Cheapest Form of Advertising</h2><p>Well... there are 2 main things:</p><ol><li><p><a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-use-meta-to-find-your-ideal-customer/">Laser focus on a specific audience</a></p></li><li><p>Custom budgets</p></li></ol><p>I've already <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-use-meta-to-find-your-ideal-customer/">talked about 1 before</a>, so let's talk about 2.</p><p>In fact, the idea of a custom budget causes a lot of businesses to make a massive mistake.</p><br><h2>What Most Businesses Get Wrong About Meta Ad Budgets</h2><p>A lot of business owners think: <i>"£5.50 one time for a coffee is a bargain. But £10/day on an ad that'll make me even more money... that's sooo overpriced."</i></p><p>And they'll set the ad's budget to £1/day.</p><p>In general, if you're spending more on your coffee than on ads, then you're doing it wrong.</p><p>So, why is this so bad?</p><p>Well... <strong>that ad can't reach enough people to make a difference</strong>.</p><p>Think of it like trying to promote a product through word of mouth, but only talking to one person per day.</p><p>That's too slow. You'll never reach anyone <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/customer-journey-attract-prospects-before-the-competition/">before your competition</a>.</p><p>There's another problem with setting a tiny budget.</p><br><h2>Meta Likes Big Spenders</h2><p>Just like you, Meta wants to make as much money as possible.</p><p>They prioritise people who spend more money on ads.</p><p>Which makes sense, right?</p><p>And don't worry, you don't need to waste a fortune on ads.</p><p>You just need to find the right amount to spend.</p><p>So, <strong>no more £1/day budgets</strong>, you're better off spending between £10-£50/day (depending on your targets, of course).</p><p>And there's something even better about budgets...</p><br><h2>Meta Only Charges Per View</h2><p>You don't just set a budget of £50/day and kiss that money goodbye.</p><p>You're only charged when someone <strong>actually sees your ad</strong>. So, you're not paying upfront.</p><p>Meaning, you'll only pay for the ad when it's actually doing something useful.</p><p>Now, this is a bit oversimplified, but the point is the same.</p><p>In reality, you can tell Meta how to charge you. Per click, per impression or whatever.</p><p>The different options have different prices, of course.</p><p><i>"Does that mean Meta could charge me more than my daily budget?"</i></p><br><h2>Meta Uses a Fixed Weekly Budget</h2><p>Say you set the daily budget to £10/day.</p><p>On some days, you'll end up spending a little bit more than £10/day.</p><p>On other days, you'll spend less than £10/day.</p><p>Meta will make sure that your <strong>weekly spend doesn't exceed 7 times the daily budget</strong>.</p><p>So, with a £10/day budget, Meta won't charge you more than £70/week.</p><p>Personally, I like to set a weekly budget, divide it by 7 and tell Meta to use that amount.</p><br><p>So, let's start using Meta Ads to cut advertising costs and gain massive results.</p><p>No more £1/day budgets, you're better off spending between £10-£50/day on your Meta Ads.</p><p>And you're only charged when someone sees your ad, so you're not paying upfront.</p><p>Finally, set a weekly budget, divide it by 7 and tell Meta to use that amount as your daily budget.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want to know how I would use Meta Ads to get your business huge results?</strong></p><a href="/free-consultation/" class="fancy-button">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a rel="nofollow" id="fb" href="https://www.facebook.com/" class="fa fa-facebook" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="in" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" class="fa fa-linkedin" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="gm" href="mailto:admin" class="fa fa-envelope" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img id="footer-logo" src="#" alt="logo"><hr><div id="legal" class="flex-row"><p>© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
