In general, good copy is more important than good design, but bad copy is far worse than poor design.</p></div><hr/><div id="blog-content"><p>Have you ever seen an ad and thought: <i>"What's the point of this ad?"</i></p><p>Or, maybe it was a website and you wondered: <i>"What's this website even for?"</i></p><p>And it took you a while to decipher what it was about.</p><p>Well, you're not alone.</p><p>This has happened to me too. So many times in fact.</p><p>And it all boils down to two things:</p><ol><li><p>Poor Copy</p></li><li><p>Poor Design</p></li></ol><p>And this is where a lot of people get stuck.</p><p>So, what's more important in marketing, copy or design?</p><br/><h2>What is "Copy" and "Design"?</h2><p>Firstly, let me clarify what I mean by "copy" and "design".</p><p>These are both generic terms that describe pretty much every form of marketing.</p><p>Be it a Meta Ad or your own website.</p><p>"Copy" refers to the text-related content of your marketing. I like to think of it as the "script" (this is more accurate for videos).</p><p>"Design" refers to the appearance of your marketing. This includes stuff like the color scheme, fonts, images etc.</p><p>So, what is it about copy and design that causes many people to get stuck?</p><br/><h2>Common Mistakes with Copy and Design</h2><p>Let's go back to the beginning of this blog.</p><p>Do you remember that ad that just didn't make any sense?</p><p>Well, it's because either (or both) copy and design were wrong.</p><p>And it's sometimes super obvious too.</p><h3>Examples of Poor Copy</h3><p>For example, poor copy could look like this:</p><ul><li><p>There's no offer, leaving the viewer thinking: <i>"what's the point of this ad?"</i>.</p></li><li><p>The first thing you see is the company's name.</p></li><li><p>Text overloads about the company's history / mission.</p></li><li><p>No call to action.</p></li></ul><p>Generally, there aren't that many things that can go wrong with copy.</p><p>But, making these mistakes will kill any marketing campaign.</p><h3>Examples of Poor Design</h3><p>Now, I've seen far worse examples of poor design, such as:</p><ul><li><p>The logo takes up 90% of the ad space.</p></li><li><p>Random, unrelated, AI-generated or stock images.</p></li><li><p>Colour schemes that would give you an epileptic fit.</p></li><li><p>Tiny fonts that blend into the background, so they're impossible to read.</p></li><li><p>...</p></li></ul><p>Seriously, I could go on and on about poor design.</p><p>Well, because there are so many tiny things that can go wrong.</p><p>But I'll talk about that in a different blog.</p><p>Now, poor design won't completely kill your marketing campaign, but it will turn away a good amount of potential customers.</p><p>And this leads to the main question...</p><br/><h2>Copy vs Design: Which is More Important?</h2><p>I guess the question really is: "What turns away more potential customers, poor copy or poor design?".</p><p>And the answer is simple: <strong>Copy is more important than design!</strong></p><p>Why?</p><p>Well, imagine you see a well-designed leaflet for a company.</p><p>The font sizes are fine, the colour scheme doesn't burn your eyes and the images are nice.</p><p>But, there's no text.</p><p>Could you tell me what the point of the leaflet is?</p><p>Probably not, right?</p><p>And this is where copy comes in.</p><p>Copy tells you exactly what issues the company is there to solve and how you can contact them.</p><p>Without these two things in your marketing, no one would ever know what your offer is.</p><p>Worse yet, even if they did know the offer, they wouldn't be able to contact you because you didn't give them any information.</p><br/><h2>The General Rule</h2><p>In short, good copy is better than good design.</p><p>You can still do well in marketing if your design is bad, just as long as your copy is good.</p><p>But if you're copy is bad... Not ideal.</p><p>Now, there are so many other subtle details about copy and design that I won't cover in this blog.</p><p>But, in upcoming blogs, I'll give a little more insight into how to write effective copy and design a captivating ad.</p><p>For now, know that good copy is far more important than good design.</p><p>Poor design can damage your marketing campaign, but poor copy will completely kill it.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br/>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Want to know how I would mix all this to boost your marketing performance?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="contact fb fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Message us on Facebook"></a><a class="contact in fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="contact gm fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><p>Â© 2025 Guppao Marketing</p><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a><a href="/legal/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
