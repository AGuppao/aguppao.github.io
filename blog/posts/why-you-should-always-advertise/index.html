You want to make more money, so you need to sell more things. But you can only sell more things if more people see your stuff (products, services etc.). So you need to advertise your stuff.</p><p>But, what happens if you don't advertise frequently?</p><p>Well... your prospects, or even your previous clients, will forget about you.</p><p>So, they'll never buy from you.</p><p>This is why you should always advertise - you want to constantly <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/continuously-close-clients-using-retargeting/">remind prospects that you exist</a>. And it doesn't matter if you don't have a new product or service, or if you don't have a sale.</p><p><i>"But, if I always advertise, won't that be really expensive?"</i></p><br><h2>Advertise Without Spending a Fortune</h2><p>Sure it'll be expensive.</p><p>Well... only if you violate all of the basic principles of <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-write-an-ad-that-sells/">writing an ad that sells</a>. And if you decide to throw away money <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-use-meta-to-find-your-ideal-customer/">advertising to everyone on Earth</a>.</p><p>But, if you're sensible about this, there's actually a super cheap way to advertise constantly.</p><p>So, what's the super cheap way of advertising?</p><br><h2>Content = Free Ads</h2><p>First of all, ads are a form of content.</p><p>They can be long-form, like this <a class="hyperint" href="/marketing-guides/">free guide to meta ads</a>. Or short-form, like social media posts.</p><p>Why is this important to know?</p><p>Well... if you want to always advertise, then you need to be able to always create new pieces of content. Right?</p><p>But, that's not easy.</p><p>It takes a lot of time and effort to create new content, and it's hard to keep coming up with new ideas.</p><p>This is probably why many companies don't advertise as much as they should. They don't have the resources to create new content all the time.</p><p>So, how can you actually come up with content ideas?</p><br><h2>Simple Guide to Content Creation</h2><p>Pick a topic you're an expert in. List a bunch of questions a non-expert would have about this topic, and answer those questions.</p><p>Then, share your answers by creating long / short-form content.</p><p>And that's it.</p><p>Do you want to know the best part?</p><br><h2>Never Run Out of Content</h2><p>Say you write an e-book.</p><p>You can turn that 1 e-book into 5 blog posts.</p><p>And guess what... you can turn those 5 blogs into 25 social media posts.</p><p>You're creating an endless supply of content just by recycling ideas.</p><p>Oh, and don't worry about running out of topics to discuss...</p><p>Just do a bit of Googling to see what others in your niche are talking about and write your own take on that topic.</p><p>In fact, you can write about almost anything. <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/improve-your-marketing-by-not-being-boring/">Just don't be boring</a>.</p><br><p>So, now you can create an endless supply of content to share.</p><p>You can use this to continuously advertise without spending a fortune and stay in front of your customers all the time.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Need help creating content for your company?</strong></p><a href="/free-consultation/" class="fancy-button">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a rel="nofollow" id="fb" href="https://www.facebook.com/" class="fa fa-facebook" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="in" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" class="fa fa-linkedin" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a rel="nofollow" id="gm" href="mailto:admin" class="fa fa-envelope" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img id="footer-logo" src="#" alt="logo"><hr><div id="legal" class="flex-row"><p>Â© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
