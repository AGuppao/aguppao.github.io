Strong winds swept away a bunch of roof tiles. Your dog was sick. Or something else.</p><p>So you did some research to find out what solutions exist. You filtered through the majority of the solutions and you picked the best one.</p><p>Congratulations, you've just been on a Customer Journey...</p><p>Sounds underwhelming?</p><p>I thought so.</p><p>But, this is a super useful concept that will help you land more clients.</p><p>So, why is the customer journey important?</p><br/><h2>Solve Problems ASAP</h2><p>Your customers have a problem and <strong>they want to solve it as soon as possible</strong>.</p><p>But they don't just go straight to the solution.</p><p>There's usually a period between the prospect having a problem and them actually solving it.</p><p>So you can use the customer journey idea to reach prospects during this period.</p><p>But what actually is the customer journey?</p><br/><h2>5 Stages of a Customer Journey</h2><p>The customer journey can be described in stages:</p><ol><li>Awareness - prospect becomes aware of a problem</li><li>Consideration - prospect researches potential solutions</li><li>Conversion - prospect chooses one of the solutions (prospect becomes a client)</li><li>Retention - client develops opinions about that solution</li><li>Advocacy - client shares experiences about that solution</li></ol><p>This gives us a <strong>formula to reach prospects as fast as possible</strong>.</p><p>You can reach out to prospects, "intercept" them, before the competition does.</p><p>How?</p><br/><h2>Magically Appear in front of Prospects</h2><p><strong>Many businesses only focus on stage 3</strong> (conversion) by directly advertising their solutions.</p><p>These guys are entering the game late. At this stage, most customers are price shopping.</p><p>Your objective is to <strong>reach the prospect early in the customer journey</strong>.</p><p>Imagine the prospect has a problem and they search for a solution.</p><p>Then BOOM... you magically appear in front of them.</p><br/><h2>Marketing for Each Stage of the Customer Journey</h2><p>All you need to do is pick a few methods for each stage. Focus your efforts on stages 1, 2 and 3. Not just 3.</p><p>What are some marketing strategies for the different stages?</p><p>For convenience, here they are in a table:</p><table><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Objective</th><th>Examples</th></tr><tr><td>Awareness</td><td>Provide informative (usually short form) content</td><td>Blogs, Social media posts (legal, safety, general statistics, misconceptions etc)</td></tr><tr><td>Consideration</td><td>Provide valuable (usually long form) content</td><td>E-books, Guides (common solutions, step-by-step instructions etc)</td></tr><tr><td>Conversion</td><td>Showcase your solution</td><td>Demos, Personalised emails, Ads</td></tr><tr><td>Retention</td><td>Maintain engagement to encourage repeating sales</td><td>Newsletters, Loyalty programs</td></tr><tr><td>Advocacy</td><td>Convert clients to "brand advocates"</td><td>Testimonials, Referrals, Influencer marketing</td></tr></table><p>These are just some examples. In reality, there are many more things you could do for each stage.</p><p>Also, by focusing on stages 1 to 3, you don't need to funnel money into stages 4 and 5. Well, the latter stages don't occur naturally of course, but they do become easier to manage.</p><br/><p>In the future, we'll look into special cases of this customer journey stuff, <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/attract-more-clients-using-2-step-lead-generation/">two-step lead generation</a> and <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/continuously-close-clients-using-retargeting/">retargeting</a>.</p><p>For now, make sure you are reaching prospects sooner during the customer journey.
