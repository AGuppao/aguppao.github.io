Anyone who sees your ad will ask this. Make sure to answer it.</p></div><hr/><div id="blog-content"><p>When was the last time you had a conversation with someone who only talked about themselves the entire time?</p><p>Did they also conveniently forget to give you a chance to say anything?</p><p>Well... this idea of someone only talking about themselves is quite common in marketing.</p><p>And that's not a good thing.</p><p>It's a quick way to kill any advertising efforts.</p><p>So, why is only talking about yourself such a sin in advertising?</p><br/><h2>Many Companies Only Talk About Themselves</h2><p>Just to clarify, when I say "companies talking about themselves", I mean whenever a company is talking about its achievements, awards, stories, history etc.</p><p>And this can be ok sometimes. I mean, if someone asks.</p><p>But, when it comes to advertising, then only talking about yourself is a problem.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Well... just like that person who only talked about themselves, you're forgetting to include the prospect in the "conversation".</p><p>You're not giving them a chance to tell you what they want.</p><p>And this is where most companies fail - they don't ask their prospects what they want.</p><p>So, why should you avoid only talking about yourself in your ads?</p><br/><h2>Only Talking About Yourself is a Waste of Money</h2><p>There are so many reasons to avoid only talking about yourself in your ads. And I won't go over all of them.</p><p>But here are some of the main ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>No one cares</strong>: Prospects don't care about you or your company. They <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/customer-journey-attract-prospects-before-the-competition/">care about their problems and how quickly you can solve them</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of focus</strong>: Your ad's not focused on a specific <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-write-an-ad-that-sells/">action you want people to take</a> (like contacting you).</p></li><li><p><strong>Boring</strong>: Your ad will have a lot of information that no one will read. These text overloads are <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/improve-your-marketing-by-not-being-boring/">boring</a>.</p></li></ul><p>So why is this bad?</p><p>Well... <strong>it wastes money</strong>!</p><p>After all, you've paid for the ad.</p><p>So, what should you include in your ad?</p><br/><h2>WIIFM</h2><p>Now, I've already gone over <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/how-to-write-an-ad-that-sells/">how to make a good ad</a>. And I won't go over all of it again.</p><p>But there is one thing that I haven't properly explained yet: WIIFM.</p><p><i>"What's 'WIIFM'?"</i></p><p>WIIFM is a super simple question.</p><p>If all of your marketing is designed to answer this question, then there's basically no reason for you to fail.</p><p>WIIFM stands for: <strong>"What's in it for Me?"</strong></p><p>So, how can you use this concept?</p><br/><h2>Why WIIFM is the Most Important Question Ever</h2><p>Put yourself in the prospect's shoes, look at your ad and ask the question "What's in it for me?".</p><p>If you can answer the question, then you're on the right track.</p><p>So, what makes this question super effective?</p><p>If you purely focus on answering this question, then you can cut out all of the extra stuff you don't need from your ad.</p><p>You won't even be tempted to put in all of the extra stuff to begin with, since it doesn't answer the question.</p><br/><h2>The Only Extra Things You Can Include</h2><p>Now, there are some cases where you can talk about yourself in your ad AND still answer WIIFM.</p><p>For example, you can include what other services your company provides.</p><p>You could include <strong>important</strong> certifications you have.</p><p>That's about it. Anything more personal (like your company's history and achievements) is just waffle.</p><p>And if you are going to include this stuff, I have two main points to make:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Keep it short</strong>: Get straight to the point. Avoid going into too much detail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep it small</strong>: Make sure it doesn't take up a lot of space on the ad. You don't want to <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/meta-ads-quickly-hook-your-audience/">distract people from the main message of your ad</a>.</p></li></ol><br/><p>So, let's stop putting in all of the extra stuff you don't need in your ad. Simply focus on the main message - your offer.</p><p>Don't be that person that only talks about themselves.</p><p>Take a look at your ad and ask "What's in it for me?". And if you can answer the question, then you have a good ad.</p><p>Talk Soon,<br/>Abhay</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Need help reviewing your ads?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/info/">Info</a><a href="/marketing-guides/">Guides</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="contact fb fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Message us on Facebook"></a><a class="contact in fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="contact gm fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><p>Â© 2025 Guppao Marketing</p><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><a href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a><a href="/legal/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a></div></footer><post-src src="/0/js/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
