Here's Why.</h1><div id="blog-meta"><img alt="logo" id="blog-post-logo" src="#"/><p id="blog-post-name">GM Team</p><p id="blog-post-date">Aug 13, 2024</p></div><hr/><div id="blog-content"><p>Most ads are like a wild fever dream, riddled with random mascots, nonsense dialogues and over the top effects. They fail on so many levels.</p><p>So, why are they so bad?</p><p>More importantly, what can you do to make sure your ads don't become like this?</p><br/><h2><i>"What's the point of this?"</i></h2><p>You probably experience this all the time. You look at an ad and just can't figure out what it's for. Even if you know what the company does.</p><p>In today's day and age, people's attention spans have dropped drastically. So, your ad must quickly get their attention.</p><p>You need them to instantly understand what your ad is about.</p><p>How?</p><p>By using a <strong>clear and concise headline</strong>. One which highlights the problem the target audience might face.</p><p>For example, instead of:<br/>"Guppao Marketing. We can help you grow your business through effective marketing."</p><p>Do:<br/>"Need help attracting more clients?"</p><p>This leads me on to my next point.</p><br/><h2><i>"What's in it for me?"</i></h2><p>Nobody cares about "we", they only care about "I". In other words, they only care about themselves.</p><p>Your ad shouldn't be a lecture about your company's background, or even your brand. Well, unless you have millions of pounds to throw away…</p><p><strong>So NO oversized logos!</strong></p><p>This rule applies to all forms of marketing: posters, websites, digital ads and everything else.</p><p>The person seeing the ad won't care. Got a unicorn in your logo? So what?</p><p>Your ads must focus on the <strong>pain points</strong> of your target audience.</p><p>Rhetorical questions, like from the previous example, are a great way to do this.</p><p>It's still important to be as concise as possible. However, at this point, you've got the audience's interest, so you could add a bit more detail.</p><p>For example, list services you offer that solve these problems.</p><br/><h2><i>"Ok… So now what do I do?"</i></h2><p>This is probably by far the <strong>worst mistake</strong> I see soooo many ads make.</p><p>Let's back up for a second.</p><p>So, you've connected with the audience via your headline. You've identified their problems. You may even have listed some solutions. But now what?</p><p>Simple.</p><p><strong>Get the audience engaged in whatever it is you're providing. Get them to contact you!</strong></p><p>How can you do this?</p><p><strong>Include a CTA</strong>, a call-to-action.</p><p>For example, direct them to your website. Give them your email address, phone number, social media account.</p><p>Don't leave prospects thinking: <i>"Ok… So now what do I do?"</i></p><p>Also, make your CTA obvious. Make it stand out. The CTA is completely redundant if the prospect doesn't see it.</p><p>Another, less talked-about, benefit to CTA's is that you can now <a class="hyperint" href="/blog/posts/ace-data-driven-marketing/">monitor the performance of your campaign</a>. Unfortunately, I'm all out of time for now.</p><br/><p>So, let's start boosting your ads' performance. Start using a clear and concise headline. Focus on the problems your target audience is facing. Include a CTA to get clients.</p><p>Talk Soon, <br/>GM Team</p></div><hr/><div class="contact-block"><p><strong>Need help designing your ads?</strong></p><a class="fancy-button" href="/free-consultation/">Get In Touch</a></div></main><footer><div class="flex-row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="/free-consultation/">Contact</a><a href="/services/">Services</a><a href="/frequently-asked-questions/">FAQ</a><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></div><hr/><div class="flex-row" style="width:50%;"><a class="fa fa-facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/" id="fb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Guppao Marketing on Facebook"></a><a class="fa fa-linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/" id="in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Reach out to us on LinkedIn"></a><a class="fa fa-envelope" href="mailto:admin" id="gm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Send us an Email"></a></div><img alt="logo" id="footer-logo" src="#"/><hr/><div class="flex-row" id="legal"><p>© 2024 Guppao Marketing</p><p><a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></p><p><a href="/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a></p></div></footer><post-src src="/assets/components/header.js"></post-src></body></html>
